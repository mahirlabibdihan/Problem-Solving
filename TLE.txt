Recursion: 
In recursive function, the more and larger the parameters are, the more time it will take.
So, we should only take the parameters that will locally change.

Vector vs Map in graph:
Vector is faster than map.

Soring:
To avoid TLE, we should use sorting algorithm with worst case time complexity <= O(nlog(n))
Example: Merge sort, Heap sort

Searching:
Use binary search over linear search, wherever possible.

Chess:
King,Queen,Knight,Rook can move all over the board.
